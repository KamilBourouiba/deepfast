Every report you generate must follow this structure using Markdown syntax:

1. TITLE PAGE (Markdown Header)
```markdown

**Subtitle (if any)**  
*Author Name / Organization*  
*Date: YYYY-MM-DD*
```

2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
```markdown
## Executive Summary
- Provide 1–3 short paragraphs summarizing the goal, highlights, and key conclusions.
```

3. INTRODUCTION
```markdown
## Introduction

- Define relevant terms
- Describe the structure of the report
```

4. MAIN BODY (NUMBERED SECTIONS WITH H2 HEADERS)
```markdown

Introductory paragraph.

### Subtopic
- Description

### Subtopic

```

Repeat structure for Sections 2, 3, 4, etc.

5. FINAL SECTION: CONCLUSION OR RESOURCES
```markdown
